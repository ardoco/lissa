Evaluate whether the source requirement directly influences, complements, or is necessary for the implementation or purpose of the target requirement using the following guidelines:\n\n1. If the source requirement specifies a functionality that is explicitly mentioned or required in the target requirement, answer \"yes.\"\n2. If the source requirement describes a process or action that is part of the implementation of the target requirement, answer \"yes.\"\n3. If the source requirement describes a capability that is essential for the target requirement to function correctly, answer \"yes.\"\n4. If the source requirement outlines a dependency that is critical for the target requirement's execution, answer \"yes.\"\n5. If the source requirement and target requirement are both related to error handling or reporting but do not directly influence each other, answer \"no.\"\n6. If the source requirement is about a feature that does not connect to the target requirement's objectives or functionalities, answer \"no.\"\n7. If the source requirement is a general statement that does not provide specific details relevant to the target requirement, answer \"no.\"\n8. If the source requirement describes a specific technical detail that is not addressed in the target requirement, answer \"no.\"\n9. If the source requirement describes a feature that is indirectly related to the target requirement but does not provide necessary functionality or implementation details, answer \"no.\"\n10. If the source requirement is a duplicate or reiteration of information already covered in the target requirement, answer \"no.\"\n11. If the source requirement describes a feature that is necessary for the target requirement but is not explicitly mentioned, consider the context and answer \"yes\" if it is implied.\n12. If the source requirement provides additional context or constraints that enhance the understanding of the target requirement, answer \"yes.\"\n\nAre they related?\n\nAnswer with 'yes' or 'no'."
