Requirement (1) states that \"Libwarc shall manage all write and read access.\" This is a high-level functional requirement that specifies the system's responsibility to handle both writing and reading operations.\n\n2. Requirement (2) specifies that \"Libwarc shall include ADT objects to handle read operations on ARC-records.\" This is a more specific requirement that focuses on the implementation detail of using ADT (Abstract Data Type) objects to manage read operations specifically on ARC-records.\n\nThe connection between these two requirements lies in the fact that both are concerned with read operations. Requirement (1) is broader, covering both read and write access, while requirement (2) narrows down to the implementation of read operations using ADT objects for a specific type of record (ARC-records).\n\nGiven that requirement (2) can be seen as a more detailed specification or a sub-requirement of the broader requirement (1), there is a traceability link between them. Requirement (2) supports the fulfillment of requirement (1) by detailing how part of the read access management (specifically for ARC-records) will be implemented.\n\nTherefore, there is a traceability link between the two requirements.\n\n<trace>yes</trace>"}
