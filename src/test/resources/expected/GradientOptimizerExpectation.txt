Question: We have two software development artifacts that may or may not be related in terms of their purpose and functionality\.

Source Artifact: '''\{source\_content\}'''
This artifact specifies a non\-functional requirement \(NFR\) that outlines the expected performance and portability of a software tool\.

Target Artifact: '''\{target\_content\}'''
This artifact describes the functional requirements and capabilities of the software tool, detailing how it will be used by end users\.

Considering the definitions and purposes of these artifacts, do they relate to each other in the context of software development?

Please answer with 'yes' or 'no'\.
