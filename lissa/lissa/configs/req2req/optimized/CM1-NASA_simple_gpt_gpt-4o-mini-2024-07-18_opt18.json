Look for shared processes, outcomes, or components.\n2. **Error Handling Consistency**: Do both requirements involve similar error handling mechanisms? Assess if they respond to failures or exceptions in a consistent manner.\n3. **Data Processing Alignment**: Do both requirements describe the same data flow, processing steps, or data handling methods? Ensure they operate within the same context and data lifecycle.\n4. **Contextual Clarity**: Are both requirements addressing the same aspect of the project? Be cautious of requirements that may seem related but pertain to different contexts, processes, or components.\n\nAdditionally, apply these rules:\n\n- If one requirement specifies a particular error handling mechanism and the other describes a general process without a clear connection to that mechanism, classify them as unrelated.\n- If both requirements focus on different components or processes within the system, even if they mention similar terms, classify them as unrelated.\n- Requirements that describe initialization or configuration processes should be closely examined for shared context; if they do not directly influence each other, classify them as unrelated.\n- If both requirements mention similar terms but do not share a common goal or context, classify them as unrelated.\n- Ensure that both requirements are not only related by terminology but also by their functional purpose and operational context.\n- Look for explicit connections in the requirements that indicate they are part of the same workflow or system interaction.\n- If the requirements are related but one is a high-level overview and the other is a low-level detail, ensure that the high-level requirement encompasses the low-level requirement's context.\n\nAre they related?\n\nAnswer with 'yes' or 'no'."
