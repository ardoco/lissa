There is no direct functional dependency or overlap between displaying a message about legacy data and merging patient records. They do not seem to influence or depend on each other directly.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, there is no clear traceability link between these two requirements.\n\n<trace>no</trace>","8829ddbd-8239-3919-a33d-e9f834d403c7":"To determine if there is a traceability link between the two requirements, we need to analyze their content and see if they are related or if one supports the other in some way.\n\nRequirement (1) specifies that the system should provide a means to view various patient-related information, including demographics, allergies, adverse reactions, and more. It is focused on the display and accessibility of comprehensive patient data.\n\nRequirement (2) specifies that the system should provide the ability to access demographic information specifically for clinician ordering, verification, and medication administration. This requirement is more focused on the use of demographic information in specific clinical processes.\n\nBoth requirements mention the access to demographic information, which is a common element. However, the context and purpose of accessing this information differ. Requirement (1) is broader and includes a wide range of patient data for general viewing, while requirement (2) is specifically about accessing demographic information for clinical tasks.\n\nThe traceability link between these two requirements can be established based on the shared element of accessing demographic information. Requirement (2) can be seen as a more specific instance or use case of the broader requirement (1), where demographic information is accessed for particular clinical purposes.\n\nTherefore, there is a traceability link between these two requirements as they both involve accessing demographic information, albeit for different purposes.\n\n<trace>yes</trace>","989d69df-f7e9-34c2-83a5-e676132a14ab":"To determine if there is a traceability link between the two requirements, we need to analyze their content and see if they are related in terms of functionality, purpose, or dependency.\n\n1. Requirement (1) specifies that the system should provide OB/GYN progress note templates based on the IHS progress note templates. This requirement is focused on the availability of specific templates for documenting OB/GYN-related information.\n\n2. Requirement (2) states that the system should provide the ability to document a patient encounter. This requirement is broader and encompasses the general functionality of documenting any patient encounter, not limited to OB/GYN.\n\nThe potential traceability link between these two requirements could be that the OB/GYN progress note templates (requirement 1) are a specific feature or subset of the broader capability to document patient encounters (requirement 2). In other words, providing OB/GYN templates is a way to fulfill part of the requirement to document patient encounters, specifically for OB/GYN cases.\n\nTherefore, there is a traceability link between these two requirements because the specific functionality described in requirement (1) supports the broader functionality described in requirement (2).\n\n<trace>yes</trace>","255d4df0-94a8-30da-8fd0-1317b64f9efc":"To determine if there is a traceability link between the two requirements, we need to analyze their content and see if they are related in terms of functionality, data, or purpose.\n\n1. Requirement (1) specifies that the system should display a list of possible matches if there are multiple patients with the same last name and the same last four digits of their social security numbers (SSN). This requirement is focused on patient identification and ensuring that the correct patient is selected when there are potential ambiguities.\n\n2. Requirement (2) specifies that the system should provide access to demographic information for clinicians, with a specific focus on ensuring that only the last four digits of the SSN are visible for patient identification. This requirement is concerned with privacy and security, ensuring that sensitive information is protected while still allowing for patient identification.\n\nBoth requirements involve the use of the last four digits of the SSN for patient identification purposes. Requirement (1) deals with resolving ambiguities when multiple patients have similar identifiers, while requirement (2) deals with the privacy aspect of displaying only part of the SSN. The common element between them is the use of the last four digits of the SSN for identifying patients, which suggests a relationship in terms of how patient identification is managed within the system.\n\nGiven this analysis, there is a traceability link between the two requirements as they both address aspects of patient identification using the last four digits of the SSN, albeit from different perspectives (ambiguity resolution and privacy/security).\n\n<trace>yes</trace>","b519dbca-5d5a-3e57-b69a-cf264c055a89":"To determine if there is a traceability link between the two requirements, we need to assess whether they are related in terms of functionality, purpose, or dependency.\n\nRequirement (1) is a broad requirement that specifies the system should provide a means to view various patient-related information, including demographics, allergies, adverse reactions, postings, clinical reminders, current medications, problems, appointments, etc. This requirement encompasses a wide range of patient data that the system should be able to display.\n\nRequirement (2) is more specific and focuses on the system's ability to display all current problems associated with a patient. This is a subset of the broader requirement (1), which includes \"problems\" as one of the types of information that should be viewable.\n\nThe traceability link here is that requirement (2) is a specific instance or component of the broader functionality described in requirement (1).

Requirement (2) specifies that the system should be able to display relevant, patient-specific laboratory test results when entering an order. This requirement focuses on a specific aspect of the ordering process, namely, the ability to view relevant test results for a patient at the time of placing an order.\n\nThe link between these two requirements is evident in the context of laboratory test management. Requirement (2) can be seen as a more detailed specification that supports the broader functionality described in requirement (1). Specifically, requirement (2) enhances the ordering process by ensuring that relevant test results are available to the user, which is a critical part of reviewing results as mentioned in requirement (1).\n\nTherefore, requirement (2) can be considered a refinement or a detailed aspect of the capabilities described in requirement (1), establishing a traceability link between them.\n\n<trace>yes</trace>","d2e1c687-9c5e-332d-984b-bc9275eba587":"To determine if there is a traceability link between the two requirements, we need to assess whether they are related in terms of functionality, data, or purpose within the system.\n\nRequirement (1) focuses on capturing and storing various risk, social, and medical factors.
